<p style="font-size: 40px;">Downloading Games on Chromebooks<p>
<hr>
<p style="font-size: 25px;">Administrators can block certain websites. A large amount of blocked websites are pages used to play video games or entertainment. There is a very easy workaround that allows you to play games hosted on your computer.<p>
<hr>
<p style="font-size: 25px; color: red;">How to download games and run them: <br>1. Find a game on GitHub that only has code in these three formats: HTML, CSS, JS.<br>2. Download it from GitHub as a Zip file.<br> 3. Go to the Zip file in your files and find the "Index.html" file inside of it.<br>4. Double click the html and it will open the game as a tab.<p>

<p style="font-size: 25px;">You may notice that the link is not normal, this is because you are running a file instead of going to a website.<p>

<p style="font-size: 30px;">I have made a Google Drive with all of the games on it here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17IW0RP85Damr3occJcFm6Mfpk3jh4Cv3?usp=share_link">Local Games</a>
