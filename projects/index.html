<p style="font-size:45px;">Github "{link} took too long to respond"<p> 
  <hr>
<p style="font-size:25px;">Recently, there has been an issue regarding github links infinitely loading. There is no known cause to this, and i myself am confused. I will update this page whenever i find a solution.<p>

<p style="font-size:15px;margin:50px;">My only theory to this is that a lot of the same IP addresses are connecting to the same site (github links)<br><br>Basically, github could have released a privacy anti-botting feature which is stopping schools from connecting occasionally. This most likely happens when a certain number of students have logged on github.io links, which prevents any more from going on it until a sopt is open. This explains why it is only working sometimes and not all the time.<p>
