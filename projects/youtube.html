<p style="font-size:45px;">YouTube Offline Bypass<p> 
  <hr>
<p style="font-size:25px;">Attempting to watch YouTube videos on a school chromebook normally results in a screen saying "You are offline." Personally, I have no idea how this happens or why it does, but there is a bypass for it.<p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <p style="font-size: 25px; color: red; text-align: left;">How to get around this block:<br>1. Click share on the YouTube video<br>2. Click "Embed" on the share page<br>3. Click "Enable privacy-enhanced mode"<br>4. Watch it from the page<p>

<p style="font-size:35px;">Theory and History<p>
  
<p style="font-size:25px;">This issue has been prevalent for a long time now, possibly a few months. A few months ago, this bug was easily fixed by adding "?t=0" to the end of the link. I discovered this on accident because I believed that it was clicking on the link from YouTube was causing it. <br><br>Recently, I discovered the trick no longer works, and the only solution was to download the video. I had given up due to not having any other solution, but I was shown a fix through the embed menu.<br><br>I don't use the YouTube embed menu, so thanks to this person, It can be fixed.<p>
