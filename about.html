<p style="font-size: 20px;">Hi, I made this website, any other sources for code are listed on the page where it was used.<p>
  
<p style="font-size: 20px;">If you want my socials, I am not going to give them away sadly, simply because I do not want people from school to be in my business. I am an animator and the host of a group that produces films. We are pretty popular and I do it as a job and a hobby. If you want to support me, ask me personally for my YouTube/TikTok/Discord Server<p>
